Great!

OK, now let's add independent horizontal and vertical scaling. When this option is checked, "fit" and "fill" will no longer be different. So basically we're scaling X & Y with different values, so the letter perfectly fits in both dimensions. In practice, I'm thinking we draw it at the "fill" scale, but with a canvas bigger than we need, so that it actually fits, then scale the canvas to fit, or something like that? Open to ideas.
